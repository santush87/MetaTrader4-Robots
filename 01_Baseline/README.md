Here are the Baselines EA's. 
- When the price go under the baseline you're going SHORT.
- When the price go above the baseline you're going LONG.

You can chose also how much will be your TP and SL
- Also very important is that when you are Short in a position and the price goes above the baseline, the order is closing automaticly and open new one in
oposide direction and vice versa!
