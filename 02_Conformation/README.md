When the two lines cross and the red one is above you're going SHORT.
When the two lines cross and the green one is above you're going LONG.
You can chose also how much will be your TP and SL

Also very important is that when you are Short in a position and the lines cross again, the order is closing automaticly and open new one in oposide direction and vice versa!
